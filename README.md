# MNIST-generation-with-GAN

Instructions:
Run gan_tensorflow.py to create and train the GAN for 100 epochs. Results of the training will be saved into the MNIST GAN results folder including a histogram of training losses for both the generator and discriminator at each epoch, as well as visualisation examples at epochs 1, 20, 50, 100.

Report:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an unsupervised architecture used for the generation of new content, based on the underlying trends and features of training data. The GAN was originally proposed by Goodfellow in 2014 and subsequently, numerous variants have been applied to a number of different tasks such as style transfer.

The framework utilises a generative approach, rather than the discriminative methods traditionally used in this field, by utilising two separate models; a generator (G), tasked with producing new instances of data, and a discriminator (D), that outputs a scalar value between 0 and 1, representing the probability that the sample is from the training data or generated by G. The principle is that both models are trained concurrently, staging a ‘game’ between the two models in a Minimax form, such that both models are able to learn to maximise their chances of besting the other; maximising the performance of both models – the generator maximising its ability to deceive the discriminator; assigning an incorrect label to its output and for the discriminator, assigning the correct label to generated samples.

The network was trained over 100 epochs and the generator achieved significantly lower loss (0.83) than the discriminator (1.25) post-training.
